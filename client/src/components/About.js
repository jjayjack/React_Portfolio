                <p className="text-content">Hello there! My name is Jocelyn and this is my site that showcases
                    projects and activities that I have done while coding. I am excited
                    to start learning new languages and diving deep within the code.
                    I am originally from Northwest Indiana where I spent time with my loving
                    parents and sister. After high school, I went to Purdue University where
                    I studied Nutrition, Fitness and Health and graduated with my Bachelor Degree.
                    Once I graduated, I was undecided what I wanted to do with my degree. I decided
                    to take some time off from school and took a position with Lowe's to help
                    me work on paying off my student loans. Once I finished paying off my loan I
                    decided that it was time to figure out what I wanted to do next. I had moved to
                    Chicago with my boyfriend and had the time to think about what I wanted to do. This
                    led me to evaluate what I enjoy doing and pointed me toward pursuing Trilogy's Bootcamp
                    through Northwestern.</p>
