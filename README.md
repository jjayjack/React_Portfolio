  ## Description:
  ReactJS is a great front-end tool in which a developer is able to create hooks and navigate through a webpage without having a specific back-end server. During this project I received a further understanding of connecting CSS, bootstrap and React to components created. This application utilized the ease of using react-router-dom specifically using switch and route to assist with front-end navigation.
